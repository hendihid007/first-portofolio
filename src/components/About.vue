        My journey into technology was sparked by winning 2nd place in the
        Cilegon City Informatics Science Olympiad, which ignited my passion for
        software development. As a final-year Informatics Engineering student
        with a background in software development, I thrive on building and
        problem-solving.

        With over four years at PT. Frisian Flag Indonesia, I honed a sharp
        analytical mindset, transitioning from QC Helper to QC Staff. This
        experience taught me discipline and a meticulous approach to data,
        skills I now channel into creating practical, data-driven software. I'm
        passionate about applying my unique blend of analytical and technical
        expertise to solve real-world challenges.
